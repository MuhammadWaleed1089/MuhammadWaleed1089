## 👋 Hi, I’m Muhammad Waleed

* 👀 I’m passionate about **Agentic AI** — systems that act autonomously with purpose, memory, and reasoning.
* 🌱 Currently learning how Agentic AI works, from tools like LangGraph and AutoGen to planning, tools, and memory architectures.
* 💞️ Open to collaborating on projects that involve building autonomous agents, LLM-based workflows, or experimenting with agent frameworks.
* 📫 Reach out to me via email (muhammadwaleed1286@gmail.com) or connect with me on GitHub.
* 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
* ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy turning cutting-edge AI concepts like agents and tool use into simple, interactive Python projects.
